    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, the necessary data are extracted from the following sources,\n\nMaster Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) from data.gov.sg\nPre-Schools Location from data.gov.sg\nCycling Path from LTADataMall\nLatest version of Singapore Airbnb listing data from Inside Airbnb\n\nNext, create two subfolders; geospatialand aspatial.\nPlace Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web), Pre-Schools Location and Cycling Path zipped files into geospatial sub-folder and unzipped them. Copy the unzipped files from their respective sub-folders and place them inside geospatial sub-folder.\nPlace listing.csv into aspatial sub-folder.\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, two R packages will be used. They are,\n\nsf: for importing, managing and processing of geospatial data, and\ntidyverse: for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data\n\nType the following code chunk.\n\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)\n\np_load function pf pacman package is used to install and load sf and tidyverse pacages into R environment.\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will import the following geospatial data into R by using st_read() of sf package,\n\nMP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL, a polygon feature layer in ESRI shapefile format\nCyclingPath, a line feature layer in ESRI shapefile format, and\nPreSchool, a point feature layer in kml file format\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses st_read() function of sf package to import MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile into R as a polygon feature data frame,\n\nmpsz = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", \n                  layer = \"MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL\")\n\nReading layer `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL' from data source \n  `C:\\Users\\Dabbie Neo\\Desktop\\Geospatial_Analytics\\dneoo\\ISSS624\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex01\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 323 features and 15 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21\n\n# dsn - to define data path\n# layer - to provide the shapefile name\n# No extension such as .shp,.dbf,.prj and .shx are needed\n\nThe result above reveals that the geospatial objects are multipolygon features. There are a total of 323 multipolygon features and 15 fields in mpsz simple feature data frame. mpsz is in SVY21 projected coordinates systems. The bounding box provides the x extend and y extend of the data.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses st_read() function of sf package to import CyclingPath shapefile into R as line feature data frame.\n\ncyclingpath = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", \n                         layer = \"CyclingPathGazette\")\n\nReading layer `CyclingPathGazette' from data source \n  `C:\\Users\\Dabbie Neo\\Desktop\\Geospatial_Analytics\\dneoo\\ISSS624\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex01\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 2558 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: MULTILINESTRING\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 11854.32 ymin: 28347.98 xmax: 42626.09 ymax: 48948.15\nProjected CRS: SVY21\n\n\nThe results above reveals that there are a total of 2558 features and 2 fields in cyclingpath linestring feature data frame and it is in SVY21 projected coordinates system too.\n\n\n\nThe pre-schools-location-kml is in kml format. The code chunk below will be used to import the kml into R. Notice that in the code chunk below, the complete path and the kml file extension were provided.\n\npreschool = st_read(\"data/geospatial/PreSchoolsLocation.kml\")\n\nReading layer `PRESCHOOLS_LOCATION' from data source \n  `C:\\Users\\Dabbie Neo\\Desktop\\Geospatial_Analytics\\dneoo\\ISSS624\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex01\\data\\geospatial\\PreSchoolsLocation.kml' \n  using driver `KML'\nSimple feature collection with 2290 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XYZ\nBounding box:  xmin: 103.6878 ymin: 1.247759 xmax: 103.9897 ymax: 1.462134\nz_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nThe result above reveals that preschool is a point feature data frame. There are a total of 2290 features and 2 fields. Different from the previous two simple feature data frame, preschool is in WGS84 coordinates system.\n\n\n\nIn this sub-section, you will learn different ways to retrieve information related to the content of a simple feature data frame.\n\n\n\nThe columns in the sf data.frame, containing the geometries, is a list of class sfc. We can retrieve the geometry list-column by mpsz$geom or mpsz[[1]]. However, the more general way uses st_geometry() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nst_geometry(mpsz)\n\nGeometry set for 323 features \nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21\nFirst 5 geometries:\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((31495.56 30140.01, 31980.96 296...\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((29092.28 30021.89, 29119.64 300...\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((29932.33 29879.12, 29947.32 298...\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((27131.28 30059.73, 27088.33 297...\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((26451.03 30396.46, 26440.47 303...\n\n\nst_geometry() displays only the basic information of the feature class such as type of geometry, the geographic extent of features and the coordinate system of the data.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below allows us to learn more about the associated attribute information in the data frame.\n\nglimpse(mpsz)\n\nRows: 323\nColumns: 16\n$ OBJECTID   <int> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, …\n$ SUBZONE_NO <int> 1, 1, 3, 8, 3, 7, 9, 2, 13, 7, 12, 6, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, …\n$ SUBZONE_N  <chr> \"MARINA SOUTH\", \"PEARL'S HILL\", \"BOAT QUAY\", \"HENDERSON HIL…\n$ SUBZONE_C  <chr> \"MSSZ01\", \"OTSZ01\", \"SRSZ03\", \"BMSZ08\", \"BMSZ03\", \"BMSZ07\",…\n$ CA_IND     <chr> \"Y\", \"Y\", \"Y\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"Y\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\",…\n$ PLN_AREA_N <chr> \"MARINA SOUTH\", \"OUTRAM\", \"SINGAPORE RIVER\", \"BUKIT MERAH\",…\n$ PLN_AREA_C <chr> \"MS\", \"OT\", \"SR\", \"BM\", \"BM\", \"BM\", \"BM\", \"SR\", \"QT\", \"QT\",…\n$ REGION_N   <chr> \"CENTRAL REGION\", \"CENTRAL REGION\", \"CENTRAL REGION\", \"CENT…\n$ REGION_C   <chr> \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\",…\n$ INC_CRC    <chr> \"5ED7EB253F99252E\", \"8C7149B9EB32EEFC\", \"C35FEFF02B13E0E5\",…\n$ FMEL_UPD_D <date> 2014-12-05, 2014-12-05, 2014-12-05, 2014-12-05, 2014-12-05…\n$ X_ADDR     <dbl> 31595.84, 28679.06, 29654.96, 26782.83, 26201.96, 25358.82,…\n$ Y_ADDR     <dbl> 29220.19, 29782.05, 29974.66, 29933.77, 30005.70, 29991.38,…\n$ SHAPE_Leng <dbl> 5267.381, 3506.107, 1740.926, 3313.625, 2825.594, 4428.913,…\n$ SHAPE_Area <dbl> 1630379.27, 559816.25, 160807.50, 595428.89, 387429.44, 103…\n$ geometry   <MULTIPOLYGON [m]> MULTIPOLYGON (((31495.56 30..., MULTIPOLYGON (…\n\n\nglimpse() reveals the data type of each files.

We are also interested to visualise the geospatial features.\n\nplot(mpsz)\n\nWarning: plotting the first 9 out of 15 attributes; use max.plot = 15 to plot\nall\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default plot of an sf object is a multi-plot of all attributes, up to a reasonable maximum as shown above. We can, however, choose to plot only the geometry by using the code chunk below.\n\nplot(st_geometry(mpsz))\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can also choose the plot the sf object by using a specific attribute as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(mpsz[\"PLN_AREA_N\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nplot() is meant for plotting the geospatial object for quick look. For high cartographic quality plot, other R packages such as tmap should be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap projection is an important property of a geospatial data. In order to perform geoprocessing using two geospatial data, we need to ensure that both geospatial data are projected using similar coordinate system.\nIn this section, you will learn how to project a simple feature data frame from one coordinate system to another coordinate system. The technical term of this process is called projection transformation.\n\n\nOne of the common issue that can happen during importing geospatial data into R is that the coordinate system of the source data is either missing (such as due to missing .proj for ESRI shapefile) or its wrongly assigned during the importing process.\nThis is an example the coordinate system of mpsz simple feature data frame by using st_crs() of sf package as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nst_crs(mpsz)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: SVY21 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21[WGS84]\",\n        DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",6326]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]]],\n    CONVERSION[\"unnamed\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"(E)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]],\n        AXIS[\"(N)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]]]\n\n\nNotice that the mpsz data frame is projected in svy21 but when we read until the end of the print, it indicates that the EPSG is 9001. This is a wrong EPSG code because the correct EPSG code for svy21 should be 3414.\nIn order to assign the correct EPSG code to mpsz data frame, st_set_crs() of sf package is used as shown in the code chunk below\n\nmpsz3414 <- st_set_crs(mpsz, 3414)\n\nWarning: st_crs<- : replacing crs does not reproject data; use st_transform for\nthat\n\n\nNow, let us check the CRS again by using the code chunk below.\n\nst_crs(mpsz3414)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: EPSG:3414 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21 / Singapore TM\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21\",\n        DATUM[\"SVY21\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        ID[\"EPSG\",4757]],\n    CONVERSION[\"Singapore Transverse Mercator\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"northing (N)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        AXIS[\"easting (E)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Cadastre, engineering survey, topographic mapping.\"],\n        AREA[\"Singapore - onshore and offshore.\"],\n        BBOX[1.13,103.59,1.47,104.07]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",3414]]\n\n\nNotice that the EPSG code is 3414 now.\n\n\n\nIn geospatial analytics, it is very common for us to transform the original data from geographic coordinate system to projected coordinate system. This is because geographic coordinate system is not appropriate if the analysis need to use distance or/and area measurements.\nLet us take preschool simple feature data frame as an example. The print below reveals that it is in wgs84 coordinate system.\nThis is a scenario that st_set_crs() is not appropriate and st_transform() of sf package should be used. This is because we need to reproject preschool from one coordinate system to another coordinate system mathemetically.\nLet us perform the projection transformation by using the code chunk below.\n\npreschool3414 <- st_transform(preschool, \n                              crs = 3414)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn practice, we need find out the appropriate project coordinate system to use before performing the projection transformation.\n\n\nNext, let’s display the content of preschool3414 sf data frame as shown below.\nNotice that it is in svy21 projected coordinate system now. Furthermore, if you refer to Bounding box:, the values are greater than 0-360 range of decimal degree commonly used by most of the geographic coordinate systems.\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, it is not unusual that we will come across data such as listing of Inside Airbnb. We call this kind of data aspatial data. This is because it is not a geospatial data but among the data fields, there are two fields that capture the x- and y-coordinates of the data points.\nIn this section, we will learn how to import an aspatial data into R environment and save it as a tibble data frame. Next, we will convert it into a simple feature data frame.\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the listings.csv data downloaded from Inside AirBnb will be used.\n\n\nSince listings data set is in csv file format, we will use read_csv() of readr package to import listing.csv as shown the code chunk below. The output R object is called listings and it is a tibble data frame.\n\nlistings <- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/listings.csv\")\n\nRows: 3483 Columns: 18\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (6): name, host_name, neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, room_type, l...\ndbl  (11): id, host_id, latitude, longitude, price, minimum_nights, number_o...\ndate  (1): last_review\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nAfter importing the data file into R, it is important for us to examine if the data file has been imported correctly.\nThe code chunk below shows list() of Base R instead of glimpse() is used to do the job.\n\nlist(listings) \n\n[[1]]\n# A tibble: 3,483 × 18\n       id name      host_id host_name neighbourhood_group neighbourhood latitude\n    <dbl> <chr>       <dbl> <chr>     <chr>               <chr>            <dbl>\n 1  71609 Villa in…  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.35\n 2  71896 Home in …  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.35\n 3  71903 Home in …  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.35\n 4 275343 Rental u… 1439258 Kay       Central Region      Bukit Merah       1.29\n 5 275344 Rental u… 1439258 Kay       Central Region      Bukit Merah       1.29\n 6 289234 Home in …  367042 Belinda   East Region         Tampines          1.34\n 7 294281 Rental u… 1521514 Elizabeth Central Region      Newton            1.31\n 8 324945 Rental u… 1439258 Kay       Central Region      Bukit Merah       1.29\n 9 330095 Rental u… 1439258 Kay       Central Region      Bukit Merah       1.29\n10 369141 Place to… 1521514 Elizabeth Central Region      Newton            1.31\n# ℹ 3,473 more rows\n# ℹ 11 more variables: longitude <dbl>, room_type <chr>, price <dbl>,\n#   minimum_nights <dbl>, number_of_reviews <dbl>, last_review <date>,\n#   reviews_per_month <dbl>, calculated_host_listings_count <dbl>,\n#   availability_365 <dbl>, number_of_reviews_ltm <dbl>, license <chr>\n\n\nThe output reveals that listing tibble data frame consists of 4252 rows and 16 columns. Two useful fields we are going to use in the next phase are latitude and longitude. Note that they are in decimal degree format. As a best guess, we will assume that the data is in wgs84 Geographic Coordinate System.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below converts listing data frame into a simple feature data frame by using st_as_sf() of sf packages\n\nlistings_sf <- st_as_sf(listings, \n                       coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n                       crs=4326) %>%\n  st_transform(crs = 3414)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning points\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the arguments above:\n\ncoords argument requires you to provide the column name of the x-coordinates first then followed by the column name of the y-coordinates.\ncrs argument requires you to provide the coordinates system in epsg format. EPSG: 4326 is wgs84 Geographic Coordinate System and EPSG: 3414 is Singapore SVY21 Projected Coordinate System. You can search for other country’s epsg code by referring to epsg.io.\n%>% is used to nest st_transform() to transform the newly created simple feature data frame into svy21 projected coordinates system.\n\n\n\nLet us examine the content of this newly created simple feature data frame.\n\nglimpse(listings_sf)\n\nRows: 3,483\nColumns: 17\n$ id                             <dbl> 71609, 71896, 71903, 275343, 275344, 28…\n$ name                           <chr> \"Villa in Singapore · ★4.44 · 2 bedroom…\n$ host_id                        <dbl> 367042, 367042, 367042, 1439258, 143925…\n$ host_name                      <chr> \"Belinda\", \"Belinda\", \"Belinda\", \"Kay\",…\n$ neighbourhood_group            <chr> \"East Region\", \"East Region\", \"East Reg…\n$ neighbourhood                  <chr> \"Tampines\", \"Tampines\", \"Tampines\", \"Bu…\n$ room_type                      <chr> \"Private room\", \"Private room\", \"Privat…\n$ price                          <dbl> 150, 80, 80, 55, 69, 220, 85, 75, 45, 7…\n$ minimum_nights                 <dbl> 92, 92, 92, 60, 60, 92, 92, 60, 60, 92,…\n$ number_of_reviews              <dbl> 20, 24, 47, 22, 17, 12, 133, 18, 6, 81,…\n$ last_review                    <date> 2020-01-17, 2019-10-13, 2020-01-09, 20…\n$ reviews_per_month              <dbl> 0.14, 0.16, 0.31, 0.17, 0.12, 0.09, 0.9…\n$ calculated_host_listings_count <dbl> 5, 5, 5, 52, 52, 5, 7, 52, 52, 7, 7, 1,…\n$ availability_365               <dbl> 89, 89, 89, 275, 274, 89, 365, 365, 365…\n$ number_of_reviews_ltm          <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ license                        <chr> NA, NA, NA, \"S0399\", \"S0399\", NA, NA, \"…\n$ geometry                       <POINT [m]> POINT (41972.5 36390.05), POINT (…\n\n\nTable above shows the content of listing_sf. Notice that a new column called geometry has been added into the data frame. On the other hand, the longitude and latitude columns have been dropped from the data frame.\n\n\n\n\nBesides providing functions to handling (i.e. importing, exporting, assigning projection, transforming projection etc) geospatial data, sf package also offers a wide range of geoprocessing (also known as GIS analysis) functions.\nIn this section, we will learn how to perform two commonly used geoprocessing functions, namely buffering and point in polygon count.\n\n\nScenario:\nThe authority is planning to upgrade the existing cycling path. To do so, they need to acquire 5 meters of reserved land on the both sides of the current cycling path. You are tasked to determine the extend of the land needed to be acquired and their total area.\nSolution:\nFirstly, st_buffer() of sf package is used to compute the 5-meter buffers around cycling paths\n\nbuffer_cycling <- st_buffer(cyclingpath, \n                               dist=5, nQuadSegs = 30)\n\nThis is followed by calculating the area of the buffers as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nbuffer_cycling$AREA <- st_area(buffer_cycling)\n\nLastly, sum() of Base R will be used to derive the total land involved.\n\nsum(buffer_cycling$AREA)\n\n1774367 [m^2]\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario:\nA pre-school service group wants to find out the number of pre-schools in each Planning Subzone.\nSolution:\nThe code chunk below performs two operations at one go. Firstly, identify pre-schools located inside each Planning Subzone by using st_intersects(). Next, length() of Base R is used to calculate numbers of pre-schools that fall inside each planning subzone.\n\nmpsz3414$`PreSch Count`<- lengths(st_intersects(mpsz3414, preschool3414))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou should not confuse with st_intersection().\n\n\nYou can check the summary statistics of the newly derived PreSch Count field by using summary() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nsummary(mpsz3414$`PreSch Count`)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n   0.00    0.00    4.00    7.09   10.00   72.00 \n\n\nTo list the planning subzone with the most number of pre-school, the top_n() of dplyr package is used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntop_n(mpsz3414, 1, `PreSch Count`)\n\nSimple feature collection with 1 feature and 16 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 39655.33 ymin: 35966 xmax: 42940.57 ymax: 38622.37\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\n  OBJECTID SUBZONE_NO     SUBZONE_N SUBZONE_C CA_IND PLN_AREA_N PLN_AREA_C\n1      189          2 TAMPINES EAST    TMSZ02      N   TAMPINES         TM\n     REGION_N REGION_C          INC_CRC FMEL_UPD_D   X_ADDR   Y_ADDR SHAPE_Leng\n1 EAST REGION       ER 21658EAAF84F4D8D 2014-12-05 41122.55 37392.39   10180.62\n  SHAPE_Area                       geometry PreSch Count\n1    4339824 MULTIPOLYGON (((42196.76 38...           72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nCalculate the density of pre-school by planning subzone\n\n\nSolution:\nFirstly, the code chunk below uses st_area() of sf package to derive the area of each planning subzone.\n\nmpsz3414$Area <- mpsz3414 %>%\n  st_area()\n\nNext, mutate() of dplyr package is used to compute the density by using the code chunk below.\n\nmpsz3414 <- mpsz3414 %>%\n  mutate(`PreSch Density` = `PreSch Count`/Area * 1000000)\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, many geospatial analytics start with Exploratory Data Analysis. In this section, we will learn how to use appropriate ggplot2 functions to create functional and yet truthful statistical graphs for EDA purposes.\nFirstly, we will plot a histogram to reveal the distribution of PreSch Density. Conventionally, hist() of R Graphics will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nhist(mpsz3414$`PreSch Density`)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the syntax is very easy to use however the output is far from meeting publication quality. Furthermore, the function has limited room for further customization.\nIn the code chunk below, appropriate ggplot2 functions will be used.\n\nggplot(data=mpsz3414, \n       aes(x= as.numeric(`PreSch Density`)))+\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Are pre-school even distributed in Singapore?\",\n       subtitle= \"There are many planning sub-zones with a single pre-school, on the other hand, \\nthere are two planning sub-zones with at least 20 pre-schools\",\n      x = \"Pre-school density (per km sq)\",\n      y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing ggplot2 method, plot a scatterplot showing the relationship between Pre-school Density and Pre-school Count.\n\n\nSolution:\n\nggplot(data=mpsz3414, \n       aes(y = `PreSch Count`, \n           x= as.numeric(`PreSch Density`)))+\n  geom_point(color=\"black\", \n             fill=\"light blue\") +\n  xlim(0, 40) +\n  ylim(0, 40) +\n  labs(title = \"\",\n      x = \"Pre-school density (per km sq)\",\n      y = \"Pre-school count\")\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`)."
